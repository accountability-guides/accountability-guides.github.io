# Accountability guides

This repository contains the source content for guides to help tech workers develop a plan for upholding the tenets of the neveragain.tech pledge. For the rendered guides, see https://accountability-guides.github.io.

## Using the guides

### Use the organization guide with a group

**[Organization guides](https://accountability-guides.github.io/organization-guides/)** are designed to help you and your colleagues create a shared body of knowledge about crucial aspects of your organizationâ€™s product design, legal policies, leadership, and culture so you can take meaningful action and make informed decisions when faced with difficult situations.

1. Meet with a group of trusted colleagues who share your concerns. Some have chosen to make their names public on [neveragain.tech](http://neveragain.tech).
2. Find the organization guide that most closely matches your group's needs.
3. Copy the questions from the guide into a safe space for collaborative writing. We recommend the [Riseup.net Etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net), since they do not store IP addresses, require https, and destroy pads after 30 days of inactivity.
4. Discuss the questions and write down answers in your shared document.


### Work through the personal guide yourself

The **[personal guide](https://accountability-guides.github.io/personal-guide)** is designed to help you evaluate your current circumstances, consider situations that may come up for you and how you will handle them, and make yourself accountable to others.

1. Copy the questions below into a text editor on your computer or the web. For a web editor, we recommend the [Riseup.net Etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net), since they do not store IP addresses, require https, and destroy pads after 30 days of inactivity.
2. Answer the questions in the assessment, possible outcomes, and planning sections.
3. Print your guide so trusted colleagues can sign the last section ("Ask colleagues to hold you accountable").
