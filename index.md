If your work involves managing or processing data about people, use these guides to develop a plan for holding yourself accountable to the [neveragain.tech pledge](http://neveragain.tech).

There are two kinds of guides on this site:

* {{ site.data.general.org-guides-name-link }} {{ site.data.general.about-org-guides }}
* {{ site.data.general.personal-guide-name-link }} {{ site.data.general.about-personal-guide }}

In creating guides for a broad audience, we may have missed topics or questions relevant to your specific situation. Feel free to include them in your planning if needed, and [open an issue or pull request](https://github.com/accountability-guides/CONTRIBUTING.md) with your feedback.
