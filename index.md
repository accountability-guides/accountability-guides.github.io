If your work involves managing or processing data about people, use these guides to develop a plan for holding your organization and yourself accountable to the [neveragain.tech pledge](http://neveragain.tech), which states:

> We refuse to participate in the creation of databases of identifying information for the United States government to target individuals based on race, religion, or national origin.

There are two kinds of guides on this site:

* {{ site.data.general.org-guides-name-link }} {{ site.data.general.about-org-guides }}
* {{ site.data.general.personal-guide-name-link }} {{ site.data.general.about-personal-guide }}

In creating guides for a broad audience, we may have missed topics or questions relevant to your specific situation. Feel free to include them in your planning if needed, and [open an issue or pull request]({{ site.data.general.github-contributing }}) with your feedback.
