# Accountability guides

This repository contains the source content for guides to help tech workers develop a plan for upholding the tenets of the neveragain.tech pledge. For the rendered guides, see https://accountability-guides.github.io.

There are two steps:

## Work through the organization guide

**[Organization guides](https://accountability-guides.github.io/organization-guides/)** are designed to help you and your coworkers create a shared body of knowledge about crucial aspects of your organization's product design, legal policies, leadership, and culture so you can take meaningful actions and make informed decisions in the face of complex or ambiguous circumstances.

1. Find the organization guide that most closely matches your organization.
2. Gather a group of trusted coworkers to work through the guide together.
3. Copy/paste the guide into a [Riseup Etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net) or other safe space for collaborative writing.
4. Work through the questions together.

## Work through the personal guide

The **[personal guide](https://accountability-guides.github.io/personal-guide)** is designed to help you assess your personal situation, think through what situations are likely to come up for you and how you will handle them, and make yourself accountable to others.

1. Copy/paste the personal guide into a [Riseup Etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net) or text editor on your computer.
2. Work through the personal assessment and scenario sections.
3. Print your guide so trusted coworkers can sign the last section ("Find coworkers to hold you accountable").
